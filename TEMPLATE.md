# Template Info (setup)

This setup is for strategy when you branch out with a fix/feat/chore branch, and do merge to main with PR

See `action_config.toml` for docker/gitops config. Update it by following all the instructions given in the file(mentioned as FIX ME).

Note: Merge all your changes to main only with a PR, this will review all your settings.


<br /><br />

Below are the repository settings and branch protection rules which you will need to configure

## Lock PR to Squash merging (setup)

![Pull_request_merge](https://github.com/Aibel365/python-app-template/blob/d5a219f73a91d787e242e775880be59e08beee8a/images/PR.png)

<br /><br /><br /><br />

## Add branch rule with require PR before merging (setup)

![Branch_Protection](https://github.com/Aibel365/python-app-template/blob/d5a219f73a91d787e242e775880be59e08beee8a/images/BP_Rule.png)
<br /><br /><br /><br />

## Require status check to pass before merging (setup)

> You will not be able to find this before you have had 1 pr, so make a dummy PR when you have pushed you config to main...

<br /><br />

## All PR titles need to start with either (info only)

Pull request review will check if you are using one of these.

- fix: Some useful text what you fix
- fix!: Some useful text why you make a breaking change with your fix
- feat: Some useful text what your feature add
- feat!: Some useful text why you make a breaking change with your feature
- chore: Some useful that what you have done, refactor/docs, forcing new build etc


## All PR need release label (info only)

Select between:

- release-auto - for following semver
- release-patch - to force patch 1.0.X
- release-minor - to force patch 1.X.0
- release-major - to force patch X.0.0
- release-skip - to skip release after merge

Note: If a label is missing in a PR then 'release-skip' label will be added by default to the PR.
